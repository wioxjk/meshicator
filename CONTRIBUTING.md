# Contributing to MeshCore

Thanks for considering contributing to this project!  

## How Can I Contribute?

### 1. Reporting Bugs
- Use the **Issues** tracker
- Use a clear title (e.g. "Crash when calling begin() with invalid pin")
- Describe the **exact steps** to reproduce
- Include your **board**, **IDE version**, **library version** and **relevant code snippet**
- Attach minimal complete example sketch if possible

### 2. Suggesting Enhancements / New Features
- Open an issue with the prefix **[Feature request]**
- Explain the use-case → what problem would this solve?
- Describe your ideal API / behavior (code examples are very helpful)

### 3. Submitting Code Changes (Pull Requests)

#### Small fixes (typos, comments, examples, small bug fixes)
→ Just open a pull request — no prior issue needed

#### Larger changes / new features
1. Open an issue first to discuss the idea
2. Get a rough 👍 from maintainer(s)
3. Fork the repo from 'dev' branch and create your branch (`fix/xxx`, `feature/yyy`, `docs/whatever`)
4. Make your changes
5. Update or add examples when appropriate
6. Add/update comments in code
7. Submit the pull request

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **One feature / fix = one pull request** (smaller PRs are easier & faster to review)
- Use descriptive commit messages
  - Good: `Fix I2C timeout handling on ESP32`
  - Bad: `update`
- Reference any related issue (`Fixes #123`, `Closes #89`, etc.)
- If you change public API, update README.md and library.properties
- New features should include an example sketch in `examples/`

## Coding Style

Please follow the existing C++ style (per the .clang-format)

- 2 spaces indentation (no tabs)
- `camelCase` for functions and variables
- `UpperCamelCase` / `PascalCase` for class names
- `#define` constants in `ALL_CAPS`
- Keep lines < ~100 characters when reasonable

(But consistency with existing code is more important than strict rules)
